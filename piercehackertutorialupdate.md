## Lesson Metadata

3. Proposed Lesson Title: How to Excel at Excel!
4. Lesson Abstract (3-4 sentences): I want to combine and update the Excel tutorials for Pierce Hacker. The currently existing tutorials are in need of better pictures, and they all should be in the same first link since it is a large topic for a single item. Having a nested Excel page prevents the overlooking of Excel tutorials mixed with non-Excel tutorials. The example of [Excel Tutorial for Stat Students](https://jloan.github.io/pierce-hacker/tutorials/2019/05/22/ExcelTutForStat.html) shows how I would like the finished nested version to look.
5. A short description of the situation/need that your lesson responds to (consider details of purpose, audience, context): Excel is a powerful tool that many majors use considerably. Having one centralized hub would make it easier for any student to find help using Excel to... wait for it... Excel.
6. Learning Outcomes of Tutorial (between 2-3): 1: Consolidate all Excel Tutorials. 2: Update existing tutorials. 3: Add additional tutorials. |
7. Course most relevant to your tutorial (if any): Anyone one that is learning Excel would be the targeted demographic.
8. Discipline/Research Area most relevant to your tutorial (delete as appropriate) Humanities / Social Sciences / Mathematics / Natural Sciences / Physical Sciences / Business-Pro-Tech / other: Everything on that list with the exception of Humanities uses Excel many regularly.
9. Intended Submission Date: Initial consolidation no later that FEB 3rd.
10. Lesson will use open technology and data at no cost to the reader Yes/No: Excel can be got for free for students.
